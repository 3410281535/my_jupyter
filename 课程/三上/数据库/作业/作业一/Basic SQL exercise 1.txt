II.You will be working with the following schemas £¨Execute script files e2c.txt and e2i.txt.£©: 

  Employee (SSN, name, salary, DNo) 
  Department (DNo, dept_name, mgr_SSN) 
  Project (PNo, location, proj_name, DNo)
  HourLog (SSN, PNo, hours) 
  
  The Employee relation provides a list of employees with their SSN, name, salary, and department number (DNo). 
The SSN is unique for each employee. Each employee belongs to only one department. The Department relation 
contains a list of the departments for the company. Its schema includes a unique department number called DNo. 
It also includes the name of the department (dept_name) and the social security number of the department's 
manager (mgr_SSN). Each department has a only one manager. The Project relation includes a unique project 
number (PNo), location, the project name (proj_name) and the department(DNo) to be responsible for it. 
An employee can be assigned to any number (including zero) projects. Each project has at least one person 
assigned to it. Finally, the HourLog relation lists for each project the number of hours of work for each 
employee who is assigned to that project. The key of this relation is SSN and PNo. 

Write SQL statements to perform the following commands. 
1. List all managers¡¯ SSN, name and salary. 
2. Find the name and the SSN of everyone who works more than 100 hours on any project; make sure there are no duplicates in the result. 
3. Find the name and the SSN of everyone who works on at least two projects. 
4. Find the name and the SSN of everyone who have never worked on any projects. 
5. Find the name and the SSN of everyone who works on all projects that "Singh" (the name of an employee) works on.
